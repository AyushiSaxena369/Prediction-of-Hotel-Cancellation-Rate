# Prediction-of-Hotel-Cancellation-Rate
The industry we have focused on is the Hospitality Industry. According to research, we found that the hotel sector operates on a low-profit margin. This makes them offer a cancellation policy to increase their customer base. Research suggests that many bookings are canceled close to guests' arrival date. This causes a huge burden on hotel operators due to the unavailability of customers at the last moment. Due to economic fluctuations, it is necessary for hotel operators to maintain a good occupancy rate to sustain their operations and prevent them from going bankrupt.   If Hotels can analyze the data and predict the number of customers that will cancel the booking, then they can take measures to increase their revenue. For example, sending discount coupons to selected customers, booking more customers than the capacity, and having non-refundable policies in some cases.
